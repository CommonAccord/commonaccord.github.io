Syntax - testing withouth the HTML tags

This document will explain how to construct a document.

As a start, you need to know that Z is a special directory that includes utilities to help you do this.
The most used feature in Z is the ability to number sections.

You can do it like so:

<quote>
	Ti=Your document title

	1.Sec=This is the first section

	2.Sec=This is the second section

	=[Z/ol/2]
</quote>
