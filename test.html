<p>This document will explain how to construct a document.</p>

<p>As a start, you need to know that Z is a special directory that includes utilities to help you do this.
The most used feature in Z is the ability to number sections.</p>

<p>You can do it like so:</p>

<quote>
<ul>
	<li>Ti=Your document title</li>
	<li>1.Sec=This is the first section</li>
	<li>2.Sec=This is the second section</li>
	<li>=[Z/ol/2]</li>
